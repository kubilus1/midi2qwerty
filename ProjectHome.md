Have your midi keyboard type midi commands.  Useful for programs that lack midi keyboard support, but could really use it, such as Deflemask.

Currently this runs on linux, and requires Xautomation and python.  Since this is written in python, this should be simple to change to use a different keyboard automation tool for another platform.
